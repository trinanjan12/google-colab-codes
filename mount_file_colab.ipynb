    This code explains how to mount google drive in google colab session.
    After mounting we can read data from the google drive directly and use it in the colab session

# Load the Drive helper and mount
from google.colab import drive

# This will prompt for authorization.
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# After executing the cell above, Drive
# files will be present in "/content/drive/My Drive".

# This will show the files of your current drive,upload your data file like csv,txt in the root dir(home page) of your google drive
!ls "/content/drive/My Drive"

# To go to the google drive root dir
cd /content/drive/My Drive

# Now you can read your file from the current dir
# I had uploaded my txt file in my drive and now i can read that file

def load_doc(filename):
	# open the file as read only
	file = open(filename, 'r')
	# read all text
	text = file.read()
	# close the file
	file.close()
	return text

# load document
in_filename = 'republic_sequences.txt'
doc = load_doc(in_filename)
